              <h1>Sony ZV-1F Price In Pakistan</h1>
              
              <p>
                Specifically designed for vloggers and online content creators, the Sony ZV-1F Vlogging Camera is a pocket-sized camera with a large 1" sensor and a 20mm-equivalent wide-angle lens. The camera allows you to snap a group selfie with an expansive view of the background scenery and get everything in the frame, even at arm's length. The lens captures a wider field of view than the human eye, enabling you to take images with eye-popping depth and perspective both indoors and outdoors. Small and lightweight, the camera is meant to be taken out and about so you can capture everyday life with ease and grab content on the go. Featuring a flip-out 3.0" touchscreen and a directional 3-capsule microphone perfect for front-facing recording, the ZV-1F also caters to those who appreciate the camera's unique Product Showcase setting, background Defocus function, real-time Eye AF (autofocus), Face Priority AE (auto-exposure), plus a new touchscreen interface, making it easier to use.
Fast and Intelligent Autofocus
Offering 425 contrast detection AF points to cover a wide area of the captured image, the ZV-1F provides high precision focusing to make sure your footage stays razor sharp. And with Eye AF mode, the camera automatically recognizes human faces and eyes, making sure your subject stays in focus in front of the lens. And switching the focus to another focal point is as easy as touching the screen. There's no need to worry about lighting either, as Face Priority AE will automatically brighten you or your subject's face.
Easy Bokeh at the Touch of a Button
With just a press of the bokeh switch, the ZV-1F lets you get beautiful defocused backgrounds like a pro. The camera's large 1" image sensor and wide f/2 aperture lens allows for true optical bokeh. Select defocus to make the main subject stand out against the defocused background bokeh, or select clear to keep the entire image in focus.
Impressive Colors to Match Your Style
Capture beautiful images to match your personal style. Choose from one of 10 available creative style presets for pro-level footage without worrying about complicated editing. Creative styles can instantly enhance contrast, highlights, shadows, saturation, sharpness, and clarity.
Beautiful Skin Tones for Everyone
Look your best any time you're shooting. Without any special settings, the camera accurately captures skin tones, ensuring a healthy and natural look. There's also a Soft Skin Effect mode to adjust skin smoothness.
Steady Footage While Walking
Showing your viewers the world around you makes for engaging content, but shaky footage can be distracting. The ZV-1F allows you to capture video clearly even while walking. Active Mode image stabilization helps to minimize image blur from handheld shooting for steadier shots.
Slow Motion & Speed
Capture touching moments in slow motion or ramp up the energy for dramatic scenes without any editing. With the ZV-1F you can easily adjust the footage speed just by pressing the Slow and Quick button. Shoot smooth video at speeds up to 5x slower, or use hyperlapse shooting to make the video up to 60x faster and bring your vision to life.
Product Showcase Setting
Put your products center stage with a single touch. Just activate the Product Showcase setting, and simply hold a product in the center of the frame. The camera will automatically focus on it with no additional gestures needed, letting your viewers concentrate on what counts.
Select the Best Scenes
The ZV-1F lets you transfer the scenes you need, saving time and storage space. By adding a Shot Mark while shooting or replaying a video, you can cut out a 15, 30, or 60 second clip to send straight to your smartphone. Shot Marks also allow you to easily find the scenes you want to use, cutting down on time searching through footage later.
Vertical Video Made Simple
Shoot vertical videos for social media just like you do on your smartphone. The ZV-1F also gives you the option of rotating horizontal video in-camera with no extra editing required. What's more, vertical videos are automatically tagged so you can transfer them straight to your smartphone, letting you get your content out to the world quickly.
Clear Voice Recording
Indoors or outdoors, the ZV-1F is designed to capture your voice clearly no matter where you're shooting. The built-in directional 3-capsule microphone collects sound from the front of the camera, giving you high-quality audio, so you can put your energy into creativity instead of worrying about the sound while recording. Additionally, when shooting outdoors and battling the wind, the camera can still record your voice clearly thanks to the supplied wind screen that drastically reduces wind noise.
Easy Smartphone Connectivity
Transfer all your recorded images and videos to your smartphone over Wi-Fi through the Imaging Edge Mobile Plus app. The app also turns your phone into a remote control for remote shooting.
Intuitive Controls
First-time camera users can easily jump straight into shooting. Control icons are displayed on the screen and are easily adjustable with just a touch, so there's no need to study complex settings.
Simple Streaming
Transform the ZV-1F into a high-quality web camera by simply connecting a compatible device via USB. The 1" image sensor and Creative Look mode ensure vibrant visuals, while the directional 3-capsule microphone gives you excellent audio.
Low Light Performance
The ZV-1F lets you capture clear video with little noise even when shooting in dimly-lit locations. While shooting in Intelligent Auto mode, you can now shoot video with the background blurred to the maximum possible extent, allowing the main subject to be captured more clearly and giving your videos extra impact.
Step-Controlled Step Zoom
With just a touch of the LCD panel, you can easily zoom into your preferred view. You can select from 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 4x to quickly change the angle of view to make sure you capture your best side.
Recording Lamp
Say goodbye to accidentally missing the action. When you press record, the recording lamp glows red and a red frame appears on the screen, letting you instantly know that you're capturing what counts.
Self-Timer Countdown
From dance videos to action shots, the ZV-1F lets you start shooting when you're ready without a panic. The large self-timer countdown appears in the center of the screen so you can clearly see when it's time to begin.
Long Battery Life
With the ZV-1F you can enjoy shooting on the go without worrying about running out of battery power. The camera includes a rechargeable battery that can be charged via the camera's USB-C port, giving you plenty of options for powering on through a shoot.
Optional Shooting Grip
Compatible with the optional GP-VPT2BT shooting grip, this device enables you to grab more stable shots and also doubles as a tripod. The grip easily rotates to have the zoom lever and recording button on either side, so you don't have to stretch around the camera body to reach key buttons.
Optional External Microphones
Raise your audio quality even further through connecting external microphones. Compatible with the ECM-G1 vlogger microphone, this mic captures sound directly in the front of the camera and minimizes unwanted noise from elsewhere. You can also record your voice from a distance with the optional ECM-W2BT wireless microphone.
